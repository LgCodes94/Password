The Password Generator project is a handy tool designed to simplify the process of creating strong and secure passwords. It offers users the ability to customize their passwords by specifying length, character
types (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols), and complexity. With a user-friendly interface, this tool is accessible to both beginners and experienced users. It employs a 
cryptographically secure random number generator to ensure the utmost unpredictability in password generation. Your online security is enhanced as the generator doesn't store or log any of the passwords it 
creates.
